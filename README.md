# bikesharing

## Purpose
  We are reviewing the bike sharing data for the city of New York. We believe this data will give us insight into the feasability for establishing a bike sharing business in Des Moines. We relalize the cities or not of the same size and the market size will be different but we feel the Des Moines and New York city customers may share many similarities.
  
  ## Trip Durations of customers. 
  
    As you can see from the chart below. our customers rarely check out our bikes for short durations of time. Although not shown on
    our graph. We can confirm on the linked tableau report. That the majority of our ridership. Rents our bikes for between 5 and 6 
    hours.

   ## Check out times by Gender.
   
   Breaking out the check out times by Gender. We can see that the majority of our bikes our rented by men. There is little variation
   between when Men or Woman are more likely to rent the bikes.

   overall men make up 65% of our customers with woman making up 25% and the last 10% unidentified. This may be a possible area
   for enhancement. The question is our woman less likely to use a bike or are we not providing them with suitable bikes or 
   safe ride locations.

   ## Trips by Weekday per Hour
   
    The heat maps below show our usage Sunday through Saturday. the darker the color the higher volume of use. Our Monday through 
    Friday shows our highest usage between 7:00am and 9:am followed by a spike again from 4:00pm to 8:00pm. On the the weekend the 
    usage of spread our more evenly between 9:00am and 7:00pm. This is an indcation that commuters are using the bike service
    to commute.

   If we break this out further by Gender. We see little change in the usage indicating the gender plays little roll in when our bikes
   are being rented.

   ## Subscriber breakdown
   
   The chart belows shows our usage breakdown by gender and subscriber. The majority of our rentals are from our subscribed users during
   the weekday. On the weekends we see the majority of our users our not subscribers. this indicates that during the week. Commuters may
   be using our bike service and on the weekends our customers or more likely tourists who would not need a subscription
   for their shorter stay in the city.

   ## Starting and Stopping Locations
   
   The two charts show the start and stop locations of our bike rentals. The larger the dot the more trips started or ended from that
   location. we can see that the majority of starting and stopping locations, as determined by the circle size, originate or end near
   the ferry locations and downtown. This is an indication that many people our using our services as part of their commute to work.

   ## Summary
   
   The data indicates the following:
    1. During the week commuters, based on time and subscription status, are using the bike sharing service.
    2. Our weekend ridership is most likely related to tourists. This based on the non-subscription status time of use.
    3. Men are much more likely to use our service then me.
    
    Based on this data. I would recommnend.
    1. addding customer zipcode data for our non-customers. This would allow us to segment how many tourists we have and
       adjust our marketing to them and in turn increase our utilization of weekend bike rentals.
       
     2. I would also look at a missed opportunity to the West of the island. We have many trips that start East of the island 
     but none that start or stop West of the Island. Do we have locations set up there.
     
     For additional visuals. We should review the following.
     1. Add a filter to the start and stop locations to filter by gender. We are assuming that our customers are all
     the same in their usage, commuter, tourist for example. By filtering we could confirm this belief.
     
     2. the second visual I would add would be start and stop locations that our the same. Are the customers bringing our
     bikes back to the same location they rented from? This would help us understand how to manage our inventory and
     prepare for demand.
